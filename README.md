# Bike-Share
This project contains daily data on daily bikeshare rentals from a European city over a two year period (over 10,000 records). I have created statistical models to estimate: (a) the number of total rental (count), (b) the number of registered rentals (registered), and (c) the number of casual rentals (casual), using predictors that you consider appropriate.
